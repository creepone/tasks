### Design Notes

##### Task

    {  _id: "3c8d8095-0a0c-4079-8625-a97378bb3b84" // PK generated by clients
	   userId: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84b"),
	   name: "Do something",
	   notes: "Elaborate on what you do",
	   categories: ["low", "work"],
	   done: false,
	   reminder: { 
		 important: true,
         time: "2012-12-28T06:15:33.035Z"
       },
	   timestamp: 0x13d22abeb32	// client timestamp of the last applied patch
    }

If the reminder is set to be important, we use chrome desktop notification and alert with sound on the device, otherwise only badges on app and in web are used . On the device, local notifications are used by default. In case the task was created / changed and not yet synchronized with the device, push notifications are used.

##### Patch

	{  _id: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84a"),
	   userId: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84b"),
       taskId: "3c8d8095-0a0c-4079-8625-a97378bb3b84",	// id of the edited task
	   deviceId: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84c"),	// device that submitted the patch (optional)
	   clientTimestamp: 0x13d22abeb32,	// timestamp of client creation
	   operation: "edit",	// add, edit, remove
	   body: { 
	     name: {
	       old: "Do something",
           new: "Do something new" 
	     },
         categories: {
		   $add: ["high"],
           $remove: ["home"]
         }
         done: true,
         reminder: {
		   time: null
         }
       }
	}

Patches are submitted from all clients. When requesting sync data, a client sends the latest patch id he got and gets all the patches submitted later.

The current set of tasks can always be reconstructed from the **complete** set of patches. However, when a patch is being applied, only for some tasks a history has to be traversed again. If the client timestamp of the patch is higher than the timestamp of the current version, it can simply be applied on the top of it.

##### Device

    {  _id: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84c"),
	   name: "Tomas Vana's iPod Touch",
       userId: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84b"),
       token: "3c8d8095-0a0c-4079-8625-a97378bb3b86", // authentication token
       apnToken: "9a22f500824611e29e960800200c9a66", // updated on each startup of the app
       version: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84a") // last patch id that was sent to this device
    }

##### User

    {  _id: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84b"),
	   name: "Tomas Vana",
       openid: "https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=..."
    }
    
##### Authentication

On the device, the authentication is only performed the very first time. After logging in with an openid that has been
associated with a valid account on the server (or creating this account on-demand), a device token is generated on the
server. Client stores this in the keychain and uses to authenticate for all the subsequent requests.

In the browser, the authentication has to be performed each time (unless there is a cookie for an already authenticated session).

##### Reminder

    {  _id: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84e"),
	   deviceId: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84c"),
	   taskId: "3c8d8095-0a0c-4079-8625-a97378bb3b84",
	   time: "2012-12-28T06:15:33.035Z",
	   patchId: ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84a") // id of the patch that changed this task
	}

On the server, there is a list of pending **important** reminders for the clients that are out-of-date. Each time a new set of patches is submitted and merged, we generate records for the added and modified reminders. As soon as the reminder's time is reached, we check whether the device still didn't get the corresponding patch and send him a push notification.

This is of course only done for devices, the web clients have to poll for the changes themselves.
